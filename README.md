Grow Planet

By Team Aogiri Tree IIIT Allahabad

Our vision is to help farmers with every information required to grow crops in a single place to
assist growth of crops. Though we are primarily focusing on India now, we have a greater vision
to help farmers all over the world at a later stage. That’s where Grow planet kicked in.
Project-Theme: Agro-Tech
Project Description:
Farmers face a lot of problems in finding correct fertilizers for crops, and correct crops for their
fields. Even if they manage to grow crops successfully, they fail to sell them at a proper price.
Moreover they miss on important news related to government subsidies on crops or new ways to
farm like organic farming, terrace farming to name a few. Our project has a mission to solve all
this problems and become a one-stop solution for all the farmers out there.
1. Plantopedia:
If a farmer wants to search info about how to grow a specific crop, our database provides him
with all the info required to grow it and what profitability he can expect of that crop. He gets
info about the following parameters: crop description, soil type required, water, fertilizer,
temperature required, time required to grow, nutrition required and cost required per unit area.
2. PlantLab:
Farmers with the use of latitudinal and longitudinal information will use that data to get the
nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, humidity, rainfall, ph, temperature of that area to get the best
possible crop for that location.
3. CropMandi:
Farmer inputs his location and crop to sell in our mandi and he gets the most economic
mandi to sell his crop at a profitable price.
4. News:
Farmers will get all the news related to the farming world. He will also get the latest
information about subsidies announced by the government.
5. Disease-Predictor:
With the use of PlantId Api, we will provide info to the farmer on what disease has
infected his crop and what measures to take based on the photos of the plant he
provides to us.
